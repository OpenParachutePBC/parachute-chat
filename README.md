# Parachute Chat

**AI assistant that knows your vault — chat with context.**

## What is Parachute Chat?

Chat is an AI-powered assistant that connects to your knowledge vault. It uses Claude to help you think, find connections, and work with your notes.

- **Context-aware**: AI has access to your vault content
- **Session continuity**: Conversations persist and resume
- **Tool use**: Claude can search, read, and modify files
- **Image generation**: Create images with local or cloud backends

---

## Quick Start

Chat requires the Base server to be running:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
cd ../base
npm install
VAULT_PATH=~/Parachute npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Run the Chat app
flutter pub get
flutter run -d macos
```
